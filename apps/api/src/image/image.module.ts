// The catalog's own module: the gate that decides whether an image may be
// used at all, the resolver that turns it into the ref a runner is given, the
// registrar that records what that ref turned out to be, the catalog the four
// HTTP routes read, and the preparation service that says whether a box is
// still waiting on a first pull. The entities are registered here because the
// app uses `autoLoadEntities` — this `forFeature` is what makes the tables
// mapped at runtime. `Box` is in it because removing an image has to know
// whether a box could still boot from it; only the entity is borrowed, not
// the box module. `OrganizationModule` is imported for the permission guard
// the controller runs, which resolves the caller's role. It does not import
// this module back, so the edge BoxModule → ImageModule → OrganizationModule
// stays acyclic.
