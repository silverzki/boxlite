 * The other three look the organization's catalog up, and a miss is not an
 * error — it means this image has not been pulled yet, and the unpinned ref is
 * passed through so the runner can pull it and report what it got.
 *
 * A hit must come back digest-pinned. That is the assertion at the bottom, and
 * it is load-bearing rather than defensive: a runner's own image cache is keyed
 * by the ref string it was handed and never re-checked, so a host that once
 * pulled `app:stable` keeps serving that build for as long as the row lives. A
 * hit that came back unpinned would make which build a box gets depend on which
